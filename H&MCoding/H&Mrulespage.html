        <h2> Rules of the MindDigits Challenge! </h2>

        <p class="para"> In the "MindDigits Challenge," you're given control over the rules of an entertaining game.
            Choose how many tries you'd want to make after first indicating the range of integers the mystery
            number will be within. Guessing the secret integer inside the selected range is your goal.
            The game gives you feedback after every guess as to whether you've found the mystery
            number or whether you still need to keep trying. The game continues until you predict
            the right number correctly or use up all of your permitted attempts. In the event that you
            exhaust your attempts, the game reveals the mystery number. You must use strategy and
            intuition to solve this fascinating number problem! </p>

        <h2> How do the difficulty ratings work? </h2>

        <p class="para"> Difficulty rating is defined by the size of the range of possible integers divided by the amount of
            alloted attemps. The higher the difficulty rating, the harder it is to guess the number! Therefore to increase the
            difficulty, you can either increase the range, or decrease the amount of attempts. To decrease the
            difficulty, you can either decrease the range, or increase the amount of attempts. </p>
