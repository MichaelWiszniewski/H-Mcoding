                <h2>About Me: Michael Wiszniewski</h2>
                <p class="para">Hello! My name is Michael Wiszniewski. I am a first-year Computer Security student at York
                    University. I have an extreme passion science and technology, as well as problem solving 
                    of any type! So far, it has been a joy to learn how to code using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                    Outside of technology, I have played hockey my entire life as well as volleyball
                    and soccer. I also love to lift weights daily and enjoying nature by going hiking in the residential area next to 
                    my neighbourhood. One of my other passions is playing the guitar. It has been very fun to 
                    learn and ignite my love for all music. Me and Harris are very excited to present to you our 
                    final project for EECS-1012! We look forward to hearing your feedback!

                <h2>About me: Harris Ghaznavi</h2>
                <p class="para"> Hello everyone! I'm Harris Ghaznavi, a first-year Computer Science student at York University. 
                    My passion lies in the art of coding, where I explore how it transforms ideas into various implementations 
                    and designs. Currently, I'm enthusiastically delving into the fundamentals of programming languages like 
                    Javascript, HTML, CSS, and more. Beyond coding, I cherish spending quality time with friends and family,
                    shooting hoops on the basketball court, staying active with workouts, and embarking on new adventures. 
                    My partner and I are thrilled to present our project, and we look forward to sharing more exciting work in the future. 
                    Thank you for checking it out!
